Here I got the data set from kaggle. Created the entire machine learning project on Jupyter Notebook.
Its a Titanic Survival Prediction Code which tells if a person survived or notmthe titanoc accident due to its crash with Iceburg
First we Pre Process the data and we analyse it.
After that Splitting of data takes place as Train and Test. I have used Logistic Regression on this.
Here we use Train data for Logistic regression model since there is binary situation as survived or not survived.
After all this Evluation of the antire code happens
I have used multiple of common libraries
